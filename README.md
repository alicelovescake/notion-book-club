## Welcome!

Can you believe our book club is celebrating our 10th anniversary?! ðŸŽ‰

Welcome to our Notion bot that populates our favorite tool with a list of books ranked by average rating and favorite count!

## How Does It Work?

### Folder Structure

```
notion-bookclub/
â”œâ”€ node_modules/
â”œâ”€ src/
â”‚  â”œâ”€ data/
â”‚  â”‚  â”œâ”€ ratings.csv
â”‚  â”œâ”€ utils/
â”‚  â”‚  â”œâ”€ errors.ts
â”‚  â”‚  â”œâ”€ index.ts
â”‚  â”‚  â”œâ”€ types.ts
â”‚  â”œâ”€ services/
â”‚  â”‚  â”œâ”€ database.ts
â”‚  â”‚  â”œâ”€ index.ts
â”‚  â”‚  â”œâ”€ parser.ts
â”‚  â”œâ”€ index.ts
â”œâ”€ .gitignore
â”œâ”€ package.json
â”œâ”€ README.md
â”œâ”€ tsconfig.json
```

## Git It Running

1. Download the zip file or `git clone` to your favorite working directory
2. `yarn` to create a large folder of node_modules
3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` to put your API key and database id
4. update `ratings.csv` in `src/data` folder if you want to change data
5. `yarn start` to update your database!
